        <div class="subheading mb-5">Mathematics for Scondary School Teaching</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I want to become a mathematics teacher because every student has the potential to learn and understand mathematics when given equal and equitable opportunities. I have experienced what good mathematics teachers can achieve in the classroom, inspiring me to pass it on to future generations. A mathematics teacher who goes above and beyond for their students allows for a mathematical understanding often never achieved in a typical classroom setting. I want to let my future students experience that“ah ha” moment in mathematics, as it confirms that they are reaching a new understanding of mathematics, just as I experienced in high school with my mathematics teacher.
        Another reason why I want to become a mathematics teacher is because I want to change the negative stigma around mathematics. Often, I’ve seen students talking about mathematics; it is usually in a negative light because there is a disconnect between what they are  learning and how it applies in the real world.” Many students often see mathematics as something concrete towards one solution rather than the logical, complex, and frequently uncertain nature math can oppose. Becoming a math teacher allows my students to help me show students both sides of the mathematical coin: equations and logic and mathematical deduction, as those skills play a role later as an adult. By exposing these skills, I hope to show students how mathematics is applied to real life and slowly change the negative stigma around mathematics.
         <br><br>

        Some personal qualities that will help me become an effective teacher in the classroom are my open mindfulness and my caring attitude. In a culturally and linguistically diverse classroom, students' backgrounds vary drastically depending on the students' environment, norms, values, and beliefs. As a result, these values can often clash in the classroom, whether a student cannot connect to the lesson at hand or from exposure to another set of values and beliefs from another student. As a teacher, my open-mindedness to people's beliefs will allow me to better understand a student's perspective, adapt to the situation, and respond effectively. Additionally, my caring attitude will further my motivation to see the student's perspective. I often care for my student's education as an AVID tutor. I demonstrate this through frequent one-on-one tutoring sessions with many students after tutorials because I genuinely care for them and want them to succeed in the math classroom.  <br><br>

         Some professional qualities that will help me become an effective teacher are my ability to communicate with others and my commitment to quality. Clear communication with others is vital in a classroom as without communication, classroom management becomes virtually impossible and often leads to confused students. My ability to communicate with others will allow me to listen to where my students are struggling the most, further adapt my approach to teaching, and help better manage the classroom. My commitment to quality will ensure that I give my students the best instruction and the ability to solve math problems and genuinely understand them. Due to my commitment, I am determined to work with the students so that they receive the best education they can get.
